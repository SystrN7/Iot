# Inception of Things (IoT)

The aim of this project is to introduce you to kubernetes from a developer's point of view. You will have to set up small clusters and discover the mechanics of continuous integration. By the end of this project, you'll be able to get a cluster up and running quickly in Docker and thus have usable continuous integration for your applications.

This project is divided into 3 parts:
 - Part 1: Install the environments tools vagrant, kubernetes and create cluster with one server and one agent.
 - Part 2: 
 - Part 3:
